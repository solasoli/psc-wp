== Frequently Asked Questions == 

1.  Question: Is there a way to do not send the email verification link if a user register with a social account. I only want to use the verification link for users that don't register with social login.
    Answer: Yes there is, create or modify the woocommerce template "my account page". In Woocommerce there is a template available for this page, and also for the register page.
    I suggest you create your own template for the login/registration page and add in there the option that customers can also register or login with their social accounts.
    Check out this guide: http://docs.woothemes.com/document/template-structure/
    So customers, when register by email verification or by your social login (plugin) and that are logged in can do their checkouts.
    
    The plugin only checks is a user is logged in and Woocommerce do not accept guest checkouts.
